## instrumentation ##

Generates chord progressions & pitch probabilities for "x" ensemble.

      @chord
      @x
      @set

## platform ##

Max standalone, built from Max 6.1.8 on Macintosh.

## behaviour ##

does not generate audio, only messages. Reacts to section message, sending previously generated notepool progressions. Requires xProducerBOT to function.

## messages ##

sends:

      @notepool (current chord);
      @pcprob (pitch set probabilities for current notepool);
      @harmRhythm (phraselength dividing by # of chords)

receives:

      @onoff (to start & stop);
      @initialize (to generate progression and send note pool);
      @section (to store and recall current sectionâ€™s progression);
      @phraselength (length in measures of current phrase);
      @exiting (to quit once ProducerBOT is done).
